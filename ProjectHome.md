# Note: As of December 31, 2013, the Myrrix project has been discontinued. Code and artifacts will remain available indefinitely. Consider migrating to [Oryx](https://github.com/cloudera/oryx). #

Myrrix is a complete, real-time, scalable clustering and recommender system, evolved from Apache Mahoutâ„¢. Just as we take for granted easy access to powerful, economical storage and computing today, Myrrix will let you take for granted easy access to large-scale learning from data.

The Serving Layer component of Myrrix is open source, and can even function as a stand-alone system suitable for moderate scale. This project hosts the open source Serving Layer from Myrrix.
